// libwayland-client, libwayland-cursor and libxkbcommon are Linux libraries. They are
// loaded with dlopen() when the Wayland backend is selected, so the bundle has no
// link-time dependency on them and costs nothing when X11 is used.
//
// Darwin arm64 passes variadic arguments on the stack and Linux arm64 passes them in
// registers, so no variadic function may be called across that boundary. Every
// function listed here takes a fixed number of arguments. In particular requests go
// through wl_proxy_marshal_array_flags() instead of the variadic
// wl_proxy_marshal_flags() used by wayland-scanner's inline stubs, and events arrive
// through wl_proxy_add_dispatcher() instead of listener structs, which libwayland calls
// through libffi with the Linux convention (events with more than 8 arguments would
// put arguments on the stack, where the two ABIs lay them out differently).
